# JLenPEG
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jjcard/JLenPEG.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jjcard/JLenPEG)

Java implementation of the brilliant image compression algorithm, [LenPEG](http://www.dangermouse.net/esoteric/lenpeg.html).
Currently, this library is only striving to implement Version 1 of the algorithm.
Note that this library is for entertainment purposes only, and should not be used in a production environment.



### Installing
Just add the library to your classpath, the Image IO service registry service will do the rest.
